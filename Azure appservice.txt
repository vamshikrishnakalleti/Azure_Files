What is meant by App Service in Azure?
Azure App Service lets you create apps faster with a one-of-a kind cloud service to quickly and easily create enterprise-ready web and mobile apps for any platform or 
device and deploy them on a scalable and reliable cloud infrastructure.

	In App Service (Web Apps, API Apps, or Mobile Apps), an app always runs in an App Service plan. In addition, Azure Functions also has the option of running in an App Service plan.
        An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run.
	The primary goal of API is to standardize data exchange between web services. Depending on the type of API, the choice of protocol changes. On the other hand, 
        REST API is an architectural style for building web services that interact via an HTTP protocol
	App Service not only adds the power of Microsoft Azure to your application, such as security, load balancing, autoscaling, and automated management. 
	Your App Service plan can be scaled up and down at any time. It is as simple as changing the pricing tier of the plan. You can choose a lower pricing tier at first and 
        scale up later when you need more App Service features. 

An App Service Environment can host your:
•	Windows web apps
•	Linux web apps
•	Docker containers (Windows and Linux)
•	Functions
•	Logic apps (Standard)
App Service Environments are appropriate for application workloads that require:
•	High scale.
•	Isolation and secure network access.
•	High memory utilization.
•	High requests per second (RPS). You can create multiple App Service Environments in a single Azure region or across multiple Azure

 regions. This flexibility makes an App Service Environment ideal for horizontally scaling stateless applications with a high RPS requirement.

                                                   ===============
used for hosting webapps and webapplications (previously azure webapps)



                                                    API APPS
                                                   ===========

APi app useful for hosing restful apis
makes it easy to devolop host and consume api in the cloud and as well as on-premises
advantage of apis in azure api app we will get direct gateway enterprise security and simple access control and automatic sdk genration and seamless integration with logic apps

                                                        LOGIC APPS

used for buisiness automation
system integration
sharing data across clouds

                                                       MOBILE APPS
                                                     ===============

hosting for mobile app backends(previously delivered by azure services) where we can deploy mobile backend services using azure mobile app

by implementing of mobile backend services on azure or mobile backend will communicate with different azure services


                                                          APPSERVICE PLANS
                                                        =======================

WITHOUT CREATING A APPSERVICE PLAN YOU DO NOT create a app service

                                                    DEPLOYMENT SLOTS
                                                 =====================

it allows you to run your function apps in different instances
slots are different environments publically exposed by publically available endpoints
one app instance will always ,ap with production slot and you can swap the instances assigned to on the demand


                                                      PRICING TIERS
                                                    =================
PRICING TIERS DEPENDING ON THE seleciton of operating systen you used at the time of creatoin
                shared compute
free and shared the two base tiers
runs on the same azure vm as other app service apps including apps of other customers
these two tiers allocate cpu quotas to each app that runs on the shared resources
resources cannot scaled out

                Dedicated compute
              =====================
basic 
standard
premium
premium v2
premium v3
these are runs on the dedicated azure vms
only apps in the same app service plan share the same compute resources 
higher the tier more vm s instances required to available to scale out 

               ISOLATED
              ===========

this isolated and isolated v2 tiers runs on the dedicated azure vms on dedicated azure virtual networks
it provides network isolation on top of compute isolation to your apps 
it provides maximum scale-out capabilities
